# Algos
Implementation of well-known (and some rare) algorithms, mostly in C++

## My goal
To add atleast 1 algorithm to the repo every week

### Want to contribute to open-source and help me achieve the goal?
1. **Fork** the repo :fork_and_knife:
2. **Add your implementation** of an algorithm that is not already in the repo (preferably in C++, but others would do just fine)
3. Submit a **pull request** ([click here to learn how](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/ "Learn how to create a pull request"))

#### Want to suggest some algorithms to add?
Just [create a new issue](https://github.com/faheel/algos/issues/new "Create a new issue") and I'll handle it from there :smile:
