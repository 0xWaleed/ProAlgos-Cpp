# Algos
Implementation of well-known (and some rare) algorithms, mostly in C++

## My goal
To add atleast 1 algorithm to the repo every week

### Want to help me achieve the goal?
1. Fork the repo :fork_and_knife:
2. Add your implementation of an algorithm that is not already in the repo (preferably in C++, but others would do just fine)
3. [Send a PR] (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/ "Learn how to create a pull request") (max. 1 per week)

#### Want to suggest some algorithms to add?
Just [create an issue] (https://github.com/faheel/algos/issues/new "Create a new issue") and I'll handle it from there :smile:
